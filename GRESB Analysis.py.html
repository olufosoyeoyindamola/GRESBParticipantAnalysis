# # Green Real Estate Sustainablity Benchmark (GRESB) Particpant Data Analysis #
# 
# I will be analysis GRESB participants with 5-star ratings in hopes of pulling common investment strategies that provide this rating. Data on GRESB particpants is sourced from GRESB website. 

# In[16]:


import pandas as pd
import os
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tabulate import tabulate


# In[2]:


rd = pd.read_csv('GRESBparticipants.csv')


# ## Isolating particpants with 5 star ratings ##
# First I'm going to clean the data from the GRESB website to take out values we won't need for this analysis such as the Development Benchmark and ISIN.

# In[3]:


rd = rd.drop(['Development Benchmark', 'ISIN'], axis = 1)


# Next we will are looking at portfolios in comparison to Goldman Sachs' so to make sure that conclusions are as accurate and as relevant as possible, I will remove particpants that are not portfolios, classified as Diversified property sectors, nature of ownership and in the Americas. We will also take out any participants that don't have 5-star ratings, because we are trying to build a dataset to figure out how they have the 5-star ratings 

# In[4]:


rg_index = rd[(rd['Region'] != 'Americas')].index
rd.drop(rg_index, inplace = True)


# In[5]:


pf_index = rd[(rd['Portfolio'] != 'Portfolio')].index
rd.drop(pf_index, inplace = True)


# In[6]:


on_index = rd[(rd['Nature of Ownership'] != 'Private')].index
rd.drop(on_index, inplace = True)


# to remove particpants without 5-star ratings we have to do something different because, intead of 'No' to denote that a partipant doesn't have ratings, we have NaaN values. Usually I would use rd = rd.dropna(subset=['5-star ratings']) to remove the NaaN values for just the '5-star rating' column. But, I actually want to take out all the NaaN values from the dataframe - so I will use rd = rd.dropna()
# 
# 

# In[7]:


rd = rd.dropna()


# Property Sector done seperately because I need to figure out how I want to include diversified property sectors. Some portfolios are classified as just 'Diversified', while others 'Diversified - sector classfication'

# In[8]:


#creating keyword list 
keyword = ['Diversified'] 
rd = rd[rd['Property Sector'].str.contains('|'.join(keyword))]


# Succeffully isolated the participants that satisfy the following conditions:
# - Must be a portfolio
# - Region must be Americas
# - Must be privately owned 
# - Must be Diversified property sector
# - Must have a 5-star rating

# Below are the twenty-two (22) GRESB particpants with 5 star ratings

# In[20]:


gresb_parts = rd['Manager']
gresb_parts = gresb_parts.drop_duplicates()
gresb_parts = gresb_parts.to_frame()
print(gresb_parts.to_markdown()) 


# ## GRESB Rating Rubric Analysis and Breakdown ##
# 
# I will be using this table to determine the highest weighted aspects as well as their subcategories to create a basis of analysis.
# 
# sample benchmark report: https://gresb-prd-public.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/RE_Documents/2021_Kilroy_Realty_BenchmarkReport.pdf

# In[10]:


#read in benchmark csv
rd_rb = pd.read_csv('GRESB Der Rubric.csv')
headers = rd_rb.head(0)


# In[11]:


rd_rb = rd_rb.drop(['Unnamed: 5'], axis = 1)


# ### Determining the Highest Weighted GRESB Benchmark Aspects ###
# First we will sort the dataframe by the highest weighted aspects of the benchmark

# In[12]:


#contains percentage sign which would affect sorting
rd_rb['Weight in Component'] = rd_rb['Weight in Component'].str.rstrip('%').astype('float') / 100.0


# In[13]:


rd_rb = rd_rb.sort_values(by ='Weight in Component', ascending = False)


# In[14]:


rd_rb = rd_rb.loc[:,['Aspects','Aspect Breakdown','Weight in Component']]
rd_rb.set_index('Aspects', inplace=True)


# Below is a pie chart depicting the weights of each Aspect in the GRESB rating

# In[15]:


plot = rd_rb.plot.pie(y = 'Weight in Component', title= 'Aspects Importance', autopct='%1.1f%%', shadow = True,                      startangle = 50, figsize =(10, 10))


# Based on the weight assigned to each component, the top aspects scored in the bench mark are:
# - Stakeholder Engagement (16.8%)
# - Leadership (11.8%)
# - Energy (10.1%)
# - Risk Mananegement (8.4%)
# - Tenants & Community (7.9%)
# - Building Certfications (7.6%)
# - Policies (7.6%)
# 
# These aspects represent aproximately the 70% (70.2%) of the score
